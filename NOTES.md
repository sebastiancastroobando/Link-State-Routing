# To-Dos
- [x] ProcessQuit -> implement using processDisconnect on the list of running link services (sebastian)
- [x] delete other branches
- [ ] Link Database Sync (look at video at timecode = 18:30) (denis)
    - [ ] Start using LSD for each router
    - [ ] start and connect should send LSA update
    - [ ] quit and disconnect should send LSA update
    - [ ] getShortestPath implement
- [ ] Write about our implementation in a README (sebastian or denis whoever gets it first).
